### Description:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11747875/147869105-330480a8-9561-4c81-8e1a-3c994991afd4.mp4

As a photographer, I wanted to find a way to display my photos in a way they could be quickly digested.  I adapted this site from [Tim Van Damme](https://css-tricks.com/author/timvandamme/)'s [Adaptive Photo Layout with Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/adaptive-photo-layout-with-flexbox/).

As I started the project, it continued to build in my mind and I decided I wanted to build it on a ReactJS framework, and then try to see if I could add some additional practice in loading photos in a more efficient way. 
<br/>
<br/>

### Project v2.0 *will* demonstrate the following:
---

- [ ] <em>User Story 1: </em> To improve architecture and the dynamic capabilities of the site, will convert it to a ReactJS app.
- [ ] <em>User Story 2: </em> To improve UX/UI, will create a navigation menu that will allow you to sort which photo category you can see.
- [ ] <em>User Story 3: </em> To improve UX/UI, will create a way to select a photo to view closer, possibly on it's own page, or possibly in a modal. 
- [ ] <em>User Story 4: </em> To improve ADA, will audit the website against Level AA ADA standards of WCAG 2.0.

### Project v1.0 demonstrates the following:
---

- [x] <em>User Story 1: </em> As a photography website, ALL photos should be the authors.  This project demonstrates not only my own photography skills, but use of color, light, form, line, and subjects to tell a story.
- [x] <em>User Story 2: </em> As a photographer, ALL photos should use a industry level POST production process.  This project demonstrates my ability to use Adobe PhotoShop, LightRoom, and Bridge.
- [x] <em>User Story 3: </em> As a web designer, the website should demonstrate responsive design on mobile, tablet, and desktop.  This project demonstrates my ability to use Flex-Box, CSS, and media queries to achieve truly responsive web design which displays in mobile, tablet, or desktop form equally as well. 
- [x] <em>User Story 4: </em> As a content heavy website, this website should minimize load times.  This project demonstrates my ability to use the Intersection Observer to achieve lazy-loading.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
